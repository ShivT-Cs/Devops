Repository for DevOps

This is the repository for the materials related to the DevOps Class

. Understand the Basics of DevOps
What is DevOps? Learn the culture, principles, and goals of DevOps — collaboration between development and operations to deliver software faster and more reliably.
Core concepts: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Monitoring, and Feedback loops.
Resources:
Free videos on YouTube (e.g., “DevOps Explained” by TechWorld with Nana)
Articles on DevOps basics (e.g., Atlassian DevOps guide)
2. Get Comfortable with Key Tools
DevOps relies heavily on automation tools. Start learning these categories:
Version control: Git & GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
CI/CD pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps Pipelines
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure ARM templates
Configuration management: Ansible, Chef, Puppet
Containerization: Docker
Container orchestration: Kubernetes
Try simple projects like:
Automating build & test with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
Writing a Terraform script to provision basic infrastructure
Creating and deploying Docker containers
3. Learn Scripting & Programming
Automation depends a lot on scripting:
Bash/shell scripting
Python (widely used for automation tasks)
PowerShell (if you work in Windows/Azure environments)
4. Hands-on Practice and Projects
Build simple pipelines to deploy apps automatically.
Use Terraform to spin up infrastructure in cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP).
Containerize an app with Docker and deploy it on Kubernetes.
Automate routine tasks using scripts.
5. Dive into Cloud Platforms
Most DevOps work happens on cloud environments:
AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Learn how to use cloud-native tools for CI/CD, infrastructure, and monitoring.
6. Monitoring & Logging
Learn tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, and how to set alerts and dashboards to monitor applications and infrastructure.
7. Study DevOps Culture & Best Practices
Continuous feedback & collaboration
Agile and Lean methodologies
Security practices (DevSecOps)
8. Get Certified (Optional but Helpful)
Certifications can guide your learning and boost your resume:
DevOps Foundations: AWS Certified DevOps Engineer, Azure DevOps Engineer Expert, Google Professional DevOps Engineer
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform Associate
Containers & Kubernetes: Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

Suggested Learning Path Summary
Learn Git and CI/CD basics
Automate small projects with Jenkins/GitHub Actions
Learn Terraform and cloud provisioning
Master Docker and Kubernetes basics
Practice scripting (Python/Bash)
Explore monitoring tools
Study DevOps culture & principles
Build real projects or contribute to open source
Optionally, get certified
